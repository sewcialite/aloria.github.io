The dip base is flexible. See notes below.  <br/>
## What you need
* 1 lb white American cheese, shredded
* 2/3 cup milk
* 1/4 cup water
* 4 oz can diced green chiles, chopped in food processor
* 5-6 slices of jalapenos from a jar, chopped in food processor
* 1 splash of pickled jalapeno juice (from the jar)
* 1 tsp of cumin, or to taste
* salt & pepper, to taste
* tortilla chips

## Do this
Microwave Method:
* In a blender, food processor, mortar & pestle, or whatever, add the 4 oz can of green chilies and sliced jalapenos and mix until smooth.
* Combine the cheese, milk, water and jalapeno juice into a large glass microwave safe bowl.
* Microwave on high for 5 minutes, stirring halfway. The mixture might seem watery, but will come together once the cheese is melted.
* Remove from the microwave and stir in the rest of the ingredients (green chilies, jalapenos, salt, pepper, and cumin)
* Microwave until everthing is steamy and combined.
* Serve immediately with tortilla chips.

Crockpot Method:
* In a blender, food processor, mortar & pestle, or whatever, add the 4 oz can of green chilies and sliced jalapenos and mix until smooth.
* Combine all ingredients in a small crockpot.
* Set on low for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
* Once melted, reduce setting to warm.
* Serve with tortilla chips.

Reheating:
* Reheat in the microwave, stirring every 30 seconds until creamy and hot. Add 1 tbsp of milk at a time if it's too thick.

## Notes
White American cheese can be found at the deli counter in your local grocery store. Add more jalapenos/jalapeno juice for extra heat,
add more cumin for more spice. I've found garlic and chili powder to be delicious additions, but not necessary. If you like a chunkier dip,
don't chop up the chilies or jalapenos in the food processor, just dump them in.
